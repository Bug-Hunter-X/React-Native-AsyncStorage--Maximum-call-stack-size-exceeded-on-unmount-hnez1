# React Native AsyncStorage Unmount Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when using `AsyncStorage` along with asynchronous operations. The error occurs when a component unmounts before an asynchronous operation, such as retrieving data from `AsyncStorage`, completes.  This leads to errors like `Maximum call stack size exceeded` or similar issues.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `useEffect` hook fetches data from `AsyncStorage`, but if the component unmounts before the data is retrieved, the asynchronous operation continues, attempting to update a component that no longer exists.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using the `AbortController` to cancel the asynchronous operation if the component unmounts.  This prevents attempts to update a non-existent component and resolves the error.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app.  You will likely not see the error immediately, but rapid unmounting/mounting cycles of the component will trigger it.
